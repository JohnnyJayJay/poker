# poker

A Clojure implementation of a poker game ([Texas Hold 'em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em)) and a corresponding Discord bot to play poker in chat.

This is (roughly) how the logic part is used:

```clojure
(require '[poker.logic.game :as poker]
         '[poker.logic.core :as cards])

(def player-budgets {"Alice" 100 "Bob" 85})
(def game (poker/start-game 10 (keys player-budgets) (shuffle cards/deck) player-budgets))

; Available functions
(poker/possible-moves game)
(poker/call game)
(poker/raise game 20)
(poker/fold game)
(poker/all-in game)
```

It is currently not published as a library, only used as the backbone for the associated Discord bot.
